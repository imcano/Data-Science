When does a machine learning algorithm has error?
  - model is under-fit (high bias)
  - model is over-fit (high variance)

Random Forest: is an ensemble learning method.
    - combines several decision trees at training stage,
      and then combines the prediction results.
    - resolves overfitting
    - reduces variance and instability

Key Notes:
  1. Uses Bootstrap Sampling to generate several training datasets
     used to train several decision trees.
  2. Uses a random selection of features for split on at each node of each decision tree.

Bagging - we try to make learners diverse by varying samples (Bootstrapping)
Random Forest - not only uses Bootstrapping but amplifies diversity by including key features
